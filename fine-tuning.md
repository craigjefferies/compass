# Fine Tuning: Adapting Clarifications with NCEA Moderation Feedback

The **Clarifications** section in Compass allows for the refinement of grading prompts and guidance based on real feedback and specific examples from NCEA moderation and exemplar documents. Fine-tuning this section helps ensure the AI teaching assistant provides feedback that aligns closely with NCEA grading standards and expected levels of achievement.

## Purpose of Fine Tuning

Fine-tuning allows Compass to:
1. **Reflect Real NCEA Standards**: Integrate insights from NCEA exemplars and moderation feedback to ensure feedback aligns with official grading criteria.
2. **Provide Specific Guidance**: Adjust feedback language to clarify what each grading level (e.g., Not Achieved, Achieved, Merit, Excellence) should look like in practice.
3. **Improve Accuracy and Consistency**: Make the assistant’s feedback more consistent with NCEA standards, promoting better student understanding of grading criteria.

## Fine-Tuning Process

Follow these steps to adjust the **Clarifications** section based on NCEA moderation feedback and exemplars:

### 1. Review NCEA Exemplars and Moderation Feedback
   - Access **NCEA exemplars** or **moderation reports** related to the specific Achievement Standard you are working with.
   - Note any **patterns** in the feedback for each grading level, particularly in areas where student work commonly falls short or excels.
   - Focus on the **key indicators** for Not Achieved, Achieved, Merit, and Excellence, and any specific language or expectations outlined in the exemplars.

### 2. Identify Key Adjustments for Each Grading Level
   - Look for any nuances in the language that could help clarify expectations. For instance, **specific descriptors** such as "comprehensive," "sophisticated," or "limited" may need more detailed guidance.
   - Note common feedback phrases or terms used by moderators and consider incorporating similar language to reinforce clarity and alignment.

### 3. Update Clarifications for Each Achievement Level
   - Adjust **Evaluation** and **Key Indicators** for each level (Not Achieved, Achieved, Merit, Excellence) based on your findings. For example:
     - **Not Achieved**: Add common reasons for missing the mark, such as insufficient examples or unclear connections to the context.
     - **Achieved**: Emphasize a basic but accurate understanding of key concepts.
     - **Merit**: Highlight deeper analysis and connection to purpose, audience, or context.
     - **Excellence**: Reinforce expectations around insightful conclusions and subtle, nuanced understanding.

### 4. Refine Prompts in the Approach Section
   - Tailor the **Approach** prompts to more effectively guide students based on the clarifications. For instance:
     - Use phrasing that prompts students to address specific shortcomings common at each level.
     - Incorporate questions that push students towards the type of analysis or detail moderators look for at higher levels.

### 5. Test with Sample Responses
   - **Simulate responses** from the teaching assistant using the newly tuned prompts.
   - Compare these responses to official NCEA exemplars to check alignment. Adjust further if the responses do not fully meet the expected level of guidance or detail.

## Example Fine-Tuning Adjustments

Here’s an example of how you might refine prompts for an Achievement Standard in English:

- **Original Clarification (Merit)**:
  - *Evaluation*: "Explains how specific examples of verbal language use are shaped by context."
  - *Key Indicators*: "Provides specific explanations that connect language choices to context, exploring their effectiveness."
  - *Approach Prompt*: “Why do you think this choice resonates with this audience?”

- **Fine-Tuned Clarification (Merit)**:
  - *Evaluation*: "Explains how context influenc
