### ACHIEVEMENT_STANDARD_GRADING_CLARIFICATIONS

- **NOT ACHIEVED (N1 & N2):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Has not fully met one or more of the **ACHIEVEMENT_CRITERIA_GRADING_LEVELS**.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** Shows limited understanding of atomic and nuclear physics concepts. May include incorrect or incomplete explanations for atomic models (e.g., Thomson’s and Rutherford’s models) or misunderstandings about nuclear transformation processes. Common errors include mixing up the properties of nuclear emissions (e.g., alpha, beta, gamma) or failing to correctly apply energy-related formulas (such as \( E = mc^2 \)). Diagrams or calculations may be unclear or missing essential details.
  - **APPROACH:** Encourage the student to clarify fundamental concepts. For example, guide them to differentiate clearly between types of nuclear reactions (fission vs. fusion) and properties of emissions (e.g., ionising vs. penetrating ability). Prompt with questions like, “How does alpha decay affect atomic and mass numbers?” or “What happens to the mass of an atom during beta decay?”

- **ACHIEVED (A3 & A4):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Demonstrates accurate understanding of atomic and nuclear physics principles and processes.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** Clearly describes basic atomic models (e.g., Rutherford’s nucleus-centered model), states outcomes of nuclear transformations, and accurately performs calculations for basic scenarios, such as half-life determinations. Recognizes and describes the main properties of nuclear emissions, including penetration and ionising abilities, but may lack detailed reasoning.
  - **APPROACH:** Encourage deeper connections by linking observed phenomena to theoretical models. For example, ask, “How did Rutherford’s observations of deflection in the gold foil experiment support the nuclear model of the atom?” or “How does half-life influence the activity level of a radioactive sample over time?”

- **MERIT (M5 & M6):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Provides in-depth reasoning on how and why atomic and nuclear physics concepts apply to various scenarios, often integrating multiple concepts and accurate mathematical calculations.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** Clearly explains the role of energy and particle behavior in nuclear reactions, such as connecting energy release with \( E = mc^2 \) in fusion and fission processes. Demonstrates understanding of half-life by interpreting decay graphs or performing multi-step decay calculations. Provides clear explanations linking atomic structure and particle emissions with ionising and penetrating abilities.
  - **APPROACH:** Guide students to analyze why specific reactions or changes occur, encouraging application of theoretical understanding. Ask questions like, “What does Rutherford’s experiment reveal about the density of the nucleus?” or “Why does gamma radiation have a high penetration ability compared to alpha particles?”

- **EXCELLENCE (E7 & E8):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Demonstrates comprehensive understanding by connecting atomic and nuclear physics principles with sophisticated explanations and detailed applications.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** Analyzes complex relationships, such as how atomic models evolved based on experimental evidence, or the role of conservation laws in nuclear transformations. Justifies conclusions using calculations, diagrams, and detailed reasoning. Effectively compares emission properties and can relate these to practical applications (e.g., medical uses of gamma emitters).
  - **APPROACH:** Encourage exploration of nuanced relationships within atomic and nuclear physics, such as the implications of \( E = mc^2 \) in nuclear energy. Probe further with, “What might Rutherford’s gold foil experiment reveal about atomic density and electron arrangement?” or “How do fission and fusion processes compare in terms of energy output and nuclear stability?”
