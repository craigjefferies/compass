### 5. Applied Scenarios (Describe → Explain → Discuss)

#### 5.1 Social Media – Hate Speech Filter

| Level | Sentence Starter | Key Points |
|-------|------------------|------------|
| **Describe** | A **Supervised Classification** model labels posts as **hate-speech** or **acceptable**, using training examples. | Name mechanism and task. |
| **Explain** | This protects users **because** hate is filtered out. A high **accuracy** (e.g., 95%) means fewer harmful posts get through. | Benefit + metric. |
| **Discuss** | But **bias** can occur: dialects not in the training set might be wrongly flagged. To fix this, balance the data or add human review. | Risk + fix = Excellence. |

#### 5.2 Car Safety – CNN Pedestrian Detection

| Level | Sentence Starter | Key Points |
|-------|------------------|------------|
| **Describe** | A **CNN** scans dash-cam images to detect **pedestrians** so the car can brake. | Name mechanism and task. |
| **Explain** | It reduces reaction time **because** the AI sees objects faster than humans. A test showed **95% accuracy**. | Benefit + metric. |
| **Discuss** | The issue is **explainability**: if the CNN misidentifies an object and brakes, engineers may not know why. **Heatmaps** can help, but not fully solve the problem. | Risk + partial mitigation. |

#### 5.3 Healthcare – LLM Discharge Summaries

| Level | Sentence Starter | Key Points |
|-------|------------------|------------|
| **Describe** | A **Transformer / LLM** reads medical notes and creates a short, plain-English **discharge summary**. | Name mechanism and task. |
| **Explain** | It saves time **because** it removes jargon and improves readability. Lower **perplexity** = better summaries. | Benefit + metric. |
| **Discuss** | However, **hallucinations** can occur — the AI might invent a dosage. **Mandatory review by doctors** and source-text quoting help avoid harm. | Risk + mitigation. |
