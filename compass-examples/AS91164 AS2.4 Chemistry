### ACHIEVEMENT_STANDARD_GRADING_CLARIFICATIONS

- **NOT ACHIEVED (N1 & N2):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Has not fully met one or more of the **ACHIEVEMENT_CRITERIA_GRADING_LEVELS**.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** Responses lack clarity, often confusing bonding types or particle types in solids. Common errors include incorrect bond counting, misunderstanding of electronegativity and polarity, and omitting valence electrons in Lewis diagrams. Limited understanding of endothermic/exothermic reactions and inaccurate use of formulas (e.g., moles calculation).
  - **APPROACH:** Guide the student to distinguish bonding types and accurately count bonds in reactions. Prompt for clarity in terms like polarity and electron density, and encourage careful use of chemistry formulas. For instance, “Can you clarify why ionic substances do not form polar molecules?”

- **ACHIEVED (A3 & A4):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Demonstrates accurate understanding of bonding, structure, properties, and energy changes.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** Correctly identifies processes, such as endothermic evaporation and exothermic reactions with negative enthalpy. Accurately draws Lewis diagrams and calculates moles, links shape and symmetry to molecular polarity, and understands that solubility is affected by attractive forces. Identifies necessary mobile particles for conductivity and labels enthalpy diagrams.
  - **APPROACH:** Encourage the student to expand on explanations by linking bonding properties to molecular behavior. Ask questions like, “How does the shape of a molecule influence its polarity?” or “Why are mobile charged particles necessary for electrical conduction?”

- **MERIT (M5 & M6):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Provides in-depth explanations that link bonding, structure, and energy changes, demonstrating a deeper level of understanding.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** Explains evaporation as an endothermic process, linking it to particle attraction strength. Carries out thermodynamic calculations accurately, explains polarity with electronegativity and symmetry, and links ionic solid solubility to solvent polarity. Correctly discusses conductivity by referring to bonding and structure differences.
  - **APPROACH:** Prompt students to analyze how specific bonds or structures contribute to observed properties, such as “How do bond angles relate to electron density regions?” or “What factors affect the solubility of an ionic solid in a polar solvent?”

- **EXCELLENCE (E7 & E8):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the links between bonding, structure, properties, and energy changes with sophisticated insights.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** Provides a detailed analysis, explaining how electronegativity, molecular symmetry, and electron density affect polarity and bond angles. Justifies energy changes with reference to bond enthalpy and reaction stoichiometry, and evaluates molecular interactions with precise use of chemistry conventions.
  - **APPROACH:** Encourage analytical depth by exploring interactions and their effects on molecular properties. Ask questions like, “How does molecular structure impact its enthalpy change?” or “What role does electron density play in determining molecular polarity and reactivity?”
