# Idea and Improvements

Due to currently using standard Gen AI interfaces and the inability to set hyperparameters, consider structuring prompts to encourage robust responses. 

In a standard prompt, include the following:

> "Please provide a comprehensive, fact-based response to the following question. Focus on well-supported information, include relevant data or sources where possible, and avoid speculative answers. Summarize key points clearly and provide a balanced perspective on the topic."

This phrasing can help guide the model to deliver well-considered, factual, and thorough answers, even when hyperparameters like temperature cannot be manually adjusted.
