## Guidance and Direction for LLMs as a Teaching Assistant

Compass is a framework that aligns Large Language Models (LLMs) to educational needs. it guides and directs LLMS to be virtual teaching assistants within New Zealand's NCEA Achievement Standards. By blending structured guidelines and ethical principles, Compass helps students gain insight into Achievement standards and empowers teachers with clear, constructive feedback tools.

## What and Why

Compass is designed to:
- **Help students** explore assessment criteria independently, developing skills without direct answers.
- **Support teachers** with tools for structured, standards-aligned feedback and moderation.
- **Ensure ethical use of AI**, fostering respect, academic integrity, and alignment with NCEA standards across subjects.

This framework provides a pathway for students and teachers to interact meaningfully with AI-powered guidance, promoting a balanced educational experience that remains rooted in genuine understanding and skill-building.

## Philosophy

At its core, Compass is driven by a commitment to **ethical, student-centered learning** and **supportive collaboration** for teachers. The framework encourages a culture of **independent exploration** by guiding students rather than providing direct answers. This approach is grounded in the belief that students can grow academically and personally when supported to think critically, reflect, and refine their understanding with gentle, well-structured guidance.

For teachers, Compass provides a foundation for objective, standards-based feedback, aiming to make assessment transparent, supportive, and focused on continuous improvement.

## Breaking Down the Problem

Compass tackles the challenge of creating effective LLM-based educational support by dividing it into key components:

### 1. General Educational LLM

   This component serves as the **base educational guide** within Compass, responsible for general responses that align with best practices in student interaction, ethics, and communication. It includes:
   - Tone and interaction guidance to ensure student-centered support.
   - Ethical guidelines to prevent the LLM from generating inaccurate or misleading information.
   - Role-specific behavior based on whether the user is a student or a teacher.

### 2. Assessment-Specific Instructions

   This section of Compass provides **targeted assistance** for each NCEA Achievement Standard. By adapting the framework to specific standards, it allows the LLM to offer more focused guidance that:
   - Aligns closely with assessment criteria and achievement levels.
   - Fosters skills and insights specific to the subject matter and assessment type.
   - Helps students understand expectations and reach new proficiency levels.

### 3. Assessment Clarifications (Fine-Tuning)

   Compass also includes **fine-tuned clarification prompts** to refine grading support and provide nuanced feedback often found in Moderation reports and assessment schedules, helping students progress to higher achievement levels (Achieved, Merit, Excellence). These prompts:
   - Highlight criteria for each grading level.
   - Offer specific guidance on areas for improvement.
   - Enable teachers to moderate and adjust feedback to meet standards requirements.
