# Trialing AI Tutoring with Teacher-Prompt Guidance in Level 2 NCEA Science

## 1. Objective
To evaluate the impact of Generative AI (Gen AI) tutoring combined with teacher instruction on prompt usage, compared to traditional active learning methods, on:
- Learning gains.
- Engagement and motivation in Level 2 NCEA Biology, Physics, and Chemistry.

---

## 2. Hypothesis
Students using Gen AI tutoring with teacher guidance on effective prompting will:
- Achieve greater learning gains.
- Report higher engagement and motivation compared to traditional methods over a 3–6 week teaching period.

---

## 3. Participants
- Pre-allocated Level 2 NCEA Science classes (Biology, Physics, Chemistry), each containing 25–30 students.
- Teacher and student consent required.

---

## 4. Study Design
A **cluster-based crossover design** is used, with extended teaching over 3–6 weeks for each concept.

### Step-by-Step Process

### 1. **Topic and Timeframe**
- Select **two standalone topics per subject**, each lasting 3–6 weeks.
  - Example:
    - **Biology:** Enzymes (Topic 1) and Photosynthesis (Topic 2).
    - **Physics:** Mechanics (Topic 1) and Waves (Topic 2).
    - **Chemistry:** Bonding (Topic 1) and Acids and Bases (Topic 2).

---

### 2. **Class Assignment**
- Divide classes into two groups:
  - **Group A:** Uses AI tutoring with teacher-prompt instruction for Topic 1, switches to traditional active learning for Topic 2.
  - **Group B:** Uses traditional active learning for Topic 1, switches to AI tutoring with teacher-prompt instruction for Topic 2.

---

### 3. **Teaching Strategy**

#### **AI-Supported Learning**
- **Week 1:**  
  - Teachers introduce the topic traditionally.
  - Provide explicit instruction on using Gen AI for effective prompting:
    - **Examples of prompts:**
      - "Explain [concept] in steps."
      - "What does [term] mean in [context]?"
      - "Can you give an example of [concept]?"

- **Weeks 2–5:**  
  - Students use Gen AI for self-paced learning during homework and in-class work.
  - Teachers monitor AI usage and refine students’ prompting skills.

- **Week 6:**  
  - Teacher-led wrap-up session with collaborative problem-solving and reflection.

#### **Traditional Active Learning**
- Teachers deliver the topic using:
  - Structured lessons.
  - Group discussions.
  - Active learning techniques such as problem-solving and peer collaboration.

---

### 4. **Data Collection Points**
1. **Pre-Test:** Conducted before starting the topic (Week 1).
2. **Progress Checks:** Weekly formative assessments to track learning.
3. **Post-Test:** Administered after completing the topic (Week 6).
4. **Surveys:** Administered after each topic to assess:
   - Engagement.
   - Motivation.
   - Perceptions of the learning experience.
5. **Time Tracking:**
   - Monitor the time spent:
     - Using Gen AI.
     - Engaging in traditional classroom activities.

---

## 5. Data Collection

### **Learning Outcomes**
- Measure learning gains using pre-test and post-test scores.
- Use weekly progress checks to monitor learning trends.

### **Engagement and Motivation**
- Analyze survey responses to compare student engagement and motivation.

### **Prompt Usage**
- Track types and frequency of prompts used by students in AI-supported learning.

### **Time on Task**
- Record total hours spent on AI-based and traditional learning activities.

---

## 6. Analysis
1. Compare learning gains, engagement, and motivation between AI-supported and traditional methods.
2. Correlate prompt quality and time spent with learning outcomes in AI-supported groups.
3. Identify trends in weekly progress checks to evaluate pacing and comprehension.

---

## 7. Results and Reflection
- Present findings to teachers and students:
  - Did AI tutoring with prompt guidance improve learning outcomes?
  - Were students more engaged and motivated?
  - How did prompt usage impact learning gains?

- Reflect on the potential for integrating AI tutoring into extended classroom instruction.

---

## 8. Tools and Resources

### **AI Tutor Platform**
- Use Gen AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) configured for:
  - Scaffolded explanations.
  - Interactive Q&A aligned with NCEA standards.

### **Prompt Framework**
- Provide students with a simple guide for effective prompting:
  - Examples:
    - "Explain [concept] step-by-step."
    - "What is the significance of [concept]?"
    - "How does [concept] connect to [other concept]?"

### **Assessments and Surveys**
- Develop pre-tests, post-tests, and surveys aligned with Level 2 NCEA standards.

### **Collaboration**
- Work closely with participating teachers to ensure:
  - Consistency in content delivery.
  - Effective monitoring of AI-supported learning.

---

## Variables to Monitor

### **Independent Variables**
- Teaching method (Gen AI with prompts vs. traditional active learning).
- Topic studied.

### **Dependent Variables**
- Learning gains (pre-test and post-test scores).
- Engagement and motivation (survey responses).

### **Controlled Variables**
- Content delivered (identical for both groups).
- Time allocated to teaching each topic.

### **Measured Variables**
- Time on task (total hours spent interacting with Gen AI).

---

## Conclusion
This extended study design evaluates the effectiveness of Gen AI tutoring, incorporating teacher-led prompt instruction, over 3–6 weeks of concept teaching in Level 2 NCEA Science. Results will inform the integration of AI into classroom teaching practices.
