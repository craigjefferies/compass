### Clarifications

#### Ideas

**Additional Notes**:
- Look for deliberate selection of ideas relevant to the topic.
- Consider elaboration through description, explanation, or evaluation.
- Assess whether the writing demonstrates abstraction or reflects on broader implications.
- The narrative develops complex and engaging ideas, connecting the events to broader themes and interactions, while further reflection could add depth and insight.

#### Structure and Language

**Additional Notes**:
- Structural features should align with the writing purpose (e.g., description, narration, persuasion).
- Evaluate control and development of language features such as tone, tense, and vocabulary appropriateness.
- Ensure the narrative consistently uses past tense and incorporates more descriptive dialogue to enhance structure and maintain the reader’s engagement.


#### Organisation

**Additional Notes**:
- Look for clear grouping and linking of ideas within and across paragraphs.
- Ensure flow through the use of logical connections and text cohesion.
- Well-structured paragraphs guide the reader effectively, with minimal interruptions in flow and clear sequencing of ideas, justifying R6.

#### Vocabulary

**Additional Notes**:
- Distinguish between descriptive and technical vocabulary based on purpose.
- Evaluate the impact of precise language choices on reader engagement.
- The deliberate and sustained use of expressive and precise language enhances mood and atmosphere, with opportunities to expand figurative elements for greater impact.

#### Sentence Structure

**Additional Notes**:
- Assess variety in sentence types and lengths.
- Look for controlled use of clauses and phrases to extend meaning.
- Sentences are varie

### Punctuation

**Additional Notes**:
- Emphasize whether punctuation aids clarity and meaning rather than focusing solely on correctness. Minor or isolated errors should not outweigh the overall effectiveness of the communication.
- Recognize and value attempts at using punctuation, even if errors occur, particularly in more complex forms. Effort to use punctuation in a way that enhances the reader's understanding should be acknowledged.
- At lower levels, prioritize effective communication and intention over technical precision, ensuring students feel encouraged to experiment with punctuation.
- Effective and deliberate use of punctuation (e.g., commas, hyphens, apostrophes) should enhance clarity. Minor or occasional errors in usage, particularly with advanced forms, should not detract from meaning or overall performance, aligning with R6.


**Additional Notes**:
- Focus on whether punctuation supports clarity and meaning rather than penalizing minor or isolated errors.
- Acknowledge attempts at using punctuation even if not always correct, especially for complex forms.
- Prioritize effective communication over technical precision at lower levels.
- Effective use of commas, hyphens, and apostrophes enhances clarity, while minor errors do not detract from meaning, aligning with R6.

#### Rubric Adjustments:
- **R3**: Some correct use of sentence punctuation. Minor errors may appear, but they do not significantly affect meaning.
- **R4**: Correct punctuation of most sentences. Some additional punctuation may be used correctly, with errors in more complex forms considered less critical.
- **R5**: Consistent sentence punctuation with correct use of additional forms (e.g., commas, quotation marks). Experimentation with complex punctuation (e.g., dashes, colons) is recognized even if partially successful.
- **R6**: Effective use of punctuation to clarify and enhance meaning. Occasional errors in advanced punctuation (e.g., semicolons, parentheses) are permissible.
- **R7**: Punctuation is deliberately controlled to direct the reader’s understanding. Few or no errors, with advanced forms used effectively and appropriately.

#### Spelling

**Additional Notes**:
- Evaluate spelling accuracy against word complexity.
- Consider attempts at applying spelling rules and phoneme–grapheme relationships.
- Spelling demonstrates strong accuracy across high-frequency and challenging words, with deliberate inclusion of complex vocabulary to support meaning.
