### Achievement Criteria Grading Levels

#### Achieved
- **Developing, Sustaining, and Structuring Ideas**:  
  Write pieces that build on ideas with appropriate comments, explanations, details, or examples, maintaining clear connections.
- **Using Language Features to Create Effects**:  
  Use language features deliberately to create meaning and effects, with only minor errors.

#### Merit
- **Developing, Sustaining, and Structuring Ideas Convincingly**:  
  Write pieces where ideas and structure are reasoned, clear, and relevant. The student must produce a crafted and controlled selection of writing that is convincing.
- **Using Language Features to Create Convincing Effects**:  
  Use language features effectively to create audience interest and meaning.
  
*Example:* The student has convincingly developed ideas about New Zealand’s negative self-image through well-researched examination and a reasoned case for national pride. Deliberate use of first person (singular and plural) helps sustain an encouraging tone.

#### Excellence
- **Developing, Sustaining, and Structuring Ideas Effectively**:  
  Write pieces where ideas are compelling, persuasive, innovative, or striking. The work should command attention.
- **Using Language Features to Command Attention**:  
  Use language features inventively and articulately, creating a distinctive voice and strong engagement.
  
*Example:* The student effectively explores what it means to be a young New Zealander in a multicultural society by presenting a personal journey of discovery. The writing employs sustained, articulate language with varied sentence structures and specific vocabulary. For further refinement, varying the format of statements and reducing repetitive phrases (e.g., “I stand”, “I have sung”) could enhance syntactical variation.

### ACHIEVEMENT STANDARD GRADING CLARIFICATIONS

#### NOT ACHIEVED (N1 & N2)
- **Evaluation:**  
  The writing does not meet the criteria for crafted and controlled writing. It may lack clear structure, sufficient idea development, or proper use of language features. Errors in text conventions or weak connections between ideas and language choices hinder overall effectiveness.
- **Key Indicators:**  
  - Underdeveloped or disconnected ideas  
  - Unclear or inconsistent structure  
  - Minimal or inaccurate use of language features with frequent errors
- **Approach:**  
  Encourage expansion and clarification of ideas with more detailed explanations and examples. Prompt revision of structure and language by asking, “How could you reorganize this section to better connect your ideas?” or “Can you choose more precise words?”

#### HIGH ACHIEVED
- **Evaluation:**  
  The student creates a crafted and controlled selection of writing appropriate to the audience and purpose. The writing demonstrates clear development, sustained ideas, and a logical structure. Language features are used effectively to create meaning and effects.
- **Key Indicators:**  
  - Well-connected ideas, with clear links (e.g., between title and closing)  
  - Structure supports idea development  
  - Use of language features (e.g., humor, reflection) engages the reader
- **Approach:**  
  Encourage deepening of some ideas (such as questioning assumptions or addressing stereotyping) and more deliberate language use to further sustain audience interest.

#### MERIT (M5 & M6)
- **Evaluation:**  
  The student produces a crafted and controlled selection of writing that is convincing. This requires developing, sustaining, and structuring ideas in a way that is reasoned and clear, and using language features to create meaning, effects, and audience interest.
- **Key Indicators:**  
  - Convincing development of ideas (e.g., well-researched examination of New Zealand’s negative self-image and a reasoned case for national pride)  
  - Deliberate language choices (e.g., first person narration) that enhance precision and tone
- **Approach:**  
  Analyze how structure and language choices support the argument. Ask  “How does your structure enhance understanding?” Suggest further development of ideas where needed.

#### EXCELLENCE (E7 & E8)
- **Evaluation:**  
  The student produces an effective, crafted, and controlled selection of writing that commands attention. This involves developing, sustaining, and structuring ideas to create a compelling narrative and using language features to achieve deep audience engagement.
- **Key Indicators:**  
  - Ideas are compelling, persuasive, or innovative (e.g., exploring young New Zealander identity through a personal journey)  
  - Expertly managed structure that enhances impact  
  - Sustained, articulate use of language features that establish a distinctive personal voice
- **Approach:**  
  Acknowledge the advanced work and encourage further refinement. Suggest varying statement formats and reducing repetitive structures (like “I stand”, “I have sung”) for greater syntactical variety. Ask, “What unique element does your language add to your message?”
