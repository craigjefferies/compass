Scientific Method for Trialing AI Tutoring with Teacher-Prompt Guidance in Level 2 NCEA Science
1. Objective
To evaluate the impact of Generative AI (Gen AI) tutoring combined with teacher instruction on prompt usage, compared to traditional active learning methods, on learning gains, engagement, and motivation in Level 2 NCEA Biology, Physics, and Chemistry over 3–6 weeks of concept instruction.

2. Hypothesis
Students using Gen AI tutoring with teacher guidance on effective prompting will achieve greater learning gains, higher engagement, and increased motivation compared to traditional methods over an extended teaching period.

3. Participants

Pre-allocated Level 2 NCEA Science classes (Biology, Physics, Chemistry), each containing 25–30 students.
Teachers and students must consent to participate.
4. Study Design
A cluster-based crossover design is used, with extended teaching over 3–6 weeks for each concept. Each class alternates between Gen AI-supported learning and traditional active learning methods for separate topics.

Step-by-Step Process
1. Topic and Timeframe
Select two separate topics per subject to be taught over 3–6 weeks each:
Example:
Biology: Enzymes (Topic 1) and Photosynthesis (Topic 2).
Physics: Mechanics (Topic 1) and Waves (Topic 2).
Chemistry: Bonding (Topic 1) and Acids and Bases (Topic 2).
2. Class Assignment
Divide classes into two groups:
Group A: Uses AI tutoring with teacher-prompt instruction for Topic 1, switches to traditional learning for Topic 2.
Group B: Uses traditional learning for Topic 1, switches to AI tutoring with teacher-prompt instruction for Topic 2.
3. Teaching Strategy
For AI-Supported Teaching:

Week 1:

Introduce the topic traditionally to all students.
Teachers provide explicit instruction on how to use Gen AI for the topic, focusing on effective prompts to:
Generate explanations.
Scaffold problem-solving.
Clarify concepts through interactive Q&A with the AI.
Weeks 2–5:

Students use Gen AI for self-paced learning and guided practice (homework and in-class work).
Teachers monitor AI usage and provide additional instruction on refining prompts and interpreting AI responses.
Week 6:

Wrap-up sessions with teacher-led discussions and collaborative problem-solving.
For Traditional Active Learning:

Teachers deliver the topic entirely through structured lessons, group work, and classroom discussions, employing active learning techniques.
4. Data Collection Points
Pre-Test: Before starting the topic (Week 1).

Progress Checks: Weekly formative assessments to track ongoing learning.

Post-Test: At the end of the topic (Week 6).

Surveys: After completing each topic, collect data on:

Engagement.
Motivation.
Perceptions of learning effectiveness.
Time Tracking: Monitor total time spent:

Using Gen AI for learning.
Engaging in traditional classroom activities.
5. Data Collection

Learning Outcomes:

Compare pre-test and post-test scores to measure learning gains for each method.
Use weekly progress checks to monitor learning trends.
Engagement and Motivation:

Analyze survey responses after each topic.
Prompt Usage:

Track the types and frequency of prompts used by students during AI-supported learning.
Time on Task:

Record the time spent on Gen AI-based and traditional learning activities.
6. Analysis

Compare learning gains, engagement, and motivation between AI-supported and traditional learning.
Correlate prompt quality and time on task with learning outcomes in the AI-supported group.
Analyze trends in weekly progress checks to identify differences in pacing and comprehension.
7. Results and Reflection

Present findings to teachers and students:

Did Gen AI-supported learning with prompt instruction lead to better outcomes?
Were students more engaged and motivated?
How did prompt usage evolve over time, and how did it impact learning?
Reflect on the potential of integrating Gen AI into extended classroom instruction.

8. Tools and Resources

AI Tutor Platform: Use Gen AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) with structured prompts aligned to NCEA standards.
Prompt Framework: Create a simple guide for students to learn effective prompts, e.g.,:
"Explain [concept] in steps."
"What does [term] mean in [context]?"
"Can you give an example of [concept]?"
Assessments and Surveys: Develop or adapt tools to align with NCEA Level 2 standards.
Collaboration: Work closely with teachers to ensure consistency in instruction and data collection.
