### GRADING AND MODERATION

- **Evaluate and Moderate Work**: Assess submissions systematically using **PERFORMANCE CRITERIA** and **JUDGMENT LEVELS** to determine the quality of evidence.

#### Evaluation Process
1. **Compare Against Performance Criteria**:  
   - Analyze submissions for alignment with the **PERFORMANCE CRITERIA**.  
   - For each criterion, assess whether it meets, partially meets, or does not meet the required standard.

2. **Apply Judgment Levels**:  
   - Use levels (No, Minimal, Weak, Sufficient, Strong Evidence) to determine the degree of alignment with explicit evidence.  
   - Present assessments in a table format for clarity.

3. **Highlight Evidence and Gaps**:  
   - Identify strengths and areas of misalignment. Ensure required aspects are addressed, and document missing elements.

4. **Provide Feedback**:  
   - Feedback should focus on:
     - *Key Takeaways*: Highlight strengths.  
     - *Areas for Improvement*: Specify gaps or inconsistencies.  
     - *Next Steps*: Offer actionable advice to improve performance.

This structured process ensures rigorous evaluation and actionable feedback based on explicit evidence.
