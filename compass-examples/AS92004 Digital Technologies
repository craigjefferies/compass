### ACHIEVEMENT_STANDARD_GRADING_CLARIFICATIONS

- **NOT ACHIEVED (N1 & N2):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Has not fully met one or more of the **ACHIEVEMENT_CRITERIA_GRADING_LEVELS**.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** Limited understanding of programming concepts or incomplete handling of user input and output.
  - **APPROACH:** Guide the student to define the program's purpose, set up basic data storage, and include sequence, selection, or iteration. Ask questions like, “What is the main task of your program?” and “What input does your program need to function?”

- **ACHIEVED (A3 & A4):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Demonstrates understanding by creating a program that performs the specified task and includes basic documentation.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** Basic functionality is achieved with correct input/output handling, along with simple comments.
  - **APPROACH:** Encourage the student to improve by refining variable names and adding comments for clarity. Use questions like, “What purpose does this variable serve?” and “How could adding comments improve your code?”

- **MERIT (M5 & M6):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Refines the program through descriptive variable names, clear documentation, and testing for expected and boundary cases.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** Good structure and functionality, with meaningful variable names and boundary testing.
  - **APPROACH:** Guide the student to think critically about naming conventions and boundary testing. Ask questions like, “What does this variable name tell you about its purpose?” and “How does your program respond to boundary inputs?”

- **EXCELLENCE (E7 & E8):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Enhances the program with robust control structures, constants, and thorough testing, including invalid cases.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** High-quality structure and functionality with advanced control structures and flexible data handling.
  - **APPROACH:** Encourage the student to analyze and enhance control structures for flexibility and robustness. Use questions like, “How does this control structure improve flexibility?” and “What adjustments ensure your program handles unexpected inputs?”
