### ACHIEVEMENT STANDARD SPECIFICS

**ACHIEVEMENT_STANDARD_TITLE**: Develop a Conceptual Design Considering Fitness for Purpose in the Broadest Sense (Technology - AS91610)  
**ACHIEVEMENT_STANDARD_PURPOSE**: This achievement standard involves developing a conceptual design considering fitness
for purpose in the broadest sense.
**ACHIEVEMENT_STANDARD_CREDITS**: Level 3, 6 Credits  

**ACHIEVEMENT_CRITERIA_GRADING_LEVELS**:

- **ACHIEVEMENT (A)**: Develop a conceptual design that considers fitness for purpose in the broadest sense by:
  - **Generating and Evaluating Design Ideas**: Establish initial conceptual designs through the generation and evaluation of ideas, informed by research.
  - **Research and Context Analysis**: Analyze existing outcomes and context considerations to guide the design process.
  - **Utilizing Functional Modelling and Stakeholder Feedback**: Use research evidence and feedback from stakeholders to assess and refine conceptual designs.
  - **Communicating the Final Design**: Present a final conceptual design that clearly communicates the proposed outcome.
  - **Explaining Suitability for the Brief**: Describe how the proposed outcome has the potential to meet the design brief’s requirements.

- **MERIT (M)**: Refine the conceptual design through a deeper process of exploration and evaluation by:
  - **Ongoing Exploration of Design Ideas**: Continuously explore and assess design ideas to determine which are most suitable for the final conceptual design.
  - **Evidence-Based Evaluation**: Use ongoing research, functional modelling, and stakeholder feedback to continually evaluate and refine the conceptual design.
  - **Addressing the Brief’s Requirements**: Demonstrate how the evolving design aligns with the brief and has a refined potential to meet its specifications.

- **EXCELLENCE (E)**: Justify the conceptual design through comprehensive synthesis and substantiation by:
  - **Synthesis of Evidence**: Integrate and synthesize research findings, functional modelling, and substantial stakeholder feedback to fully substantiate the design’s potential.
  - **Supporting the Design with Stakeholder Input**: Provide detailed justification for design choices based on significant stakeholder input and evidence from multiple sources.
  - **Demonstrating Suitability for the Brief**: Justify how the conceptual design thoroughly meets the brief’s requirements, demonstrating an in-depth understanding of fitness for purpose.

**ACHIEVEMENT_STANDARD_KEY_TERMS**:
- **Context**: The broader social and physical environment where technological development occurs.
- **Conceptual Design**: A detailed, visual representation of a proposed technological outcome.
- **Brief**: Allows assessment of the outcome’s **fitness for purpose in the broadest sense**, encompassing the design and development process.
- **Fitness for Purpose in the Broadest Sense**: Comprehensive assessment of the outcome and design process.
- **Functional Modelling**: Process of exploring, evaluating, and refining design ideas to gather evidence on feasibility, functionality, and social acceptability.

### ACHIEVEMENT_STANDARD_GRADING CLARIFICATIONS

- **NOT ACHIEVED (N1 & N2):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Has not fully met one or more of the **ACHIEVEMENT_CRITERIA_GRADING_LEVELS**.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** Missing elements like design ideas informed by research or feedback or failure to communicate a final conceptual design.
  - **APPROACH:** Guide the student to gather insights from stakeholders and research. Ask, “What have you learned from similar designs?” and “How has feedback shaped your design?”

- **ACHIEVED (A3 & A4):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Demonstrates understanding by developing a conceptual design based on research and feedback.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** Clear generation and evaluation of design ideas with some consideration of fitness for purpose.
  - **APPROACH:** Encourage exploration of additional design ideas and addressing the brief. Ask, “What makes this design suitable?” and “How has research influenced this design?”

- **MERIT (M5 & M6):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Refines the design by continuously evaluating it through research and stakeholder feedback.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** Iterative development informed by ongoing research and feedback.
  - **APPROACH:** Guide analysis of how feedback refines design. Ask, “What changes did you make based on input?” and “How has ongoing research contributed?”

- **EXCELLENCE (E7 & E8):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Justifies the conceptual design through comprehensive synthesis of research and feedback.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** High-level understanding shown by substantial stakeholder input and analysis.
  - **APPROACH:** Encourage reflection on broader implications. Ask, “Why choose this design?” and “How does it address long-term needs?”
