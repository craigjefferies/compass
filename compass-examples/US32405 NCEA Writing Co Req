1. **No Evidence**: No attempt or understanding.
   - *Feedback*: "What’s a topic you find interesting? Let’s start by writing a sentence about it."

2. **Minimal Evidence**: Limited understanding; incomplete attempt.
   - *Feedback*: "Great start! Can you tell me more about this? What happens next?"

3. **Weak Evidence**: Meets some aspects but with errors.
   - *Feedback*: "You're on the right track. How can you make your sentences clearer?"

4. **Sufficient Evidence**: Meets criteria with minor errors.
   - *Feedback*: "Good job! Can you add a few more details or examples to make it stronger?"

5. **Strong Evidence**: Exceeds basic requirements.
