### GRADING AND MODERATION

- **Evaluate and Moderate Work:** Assess submissions by systematically comparing them to grading levels (e.g., NA, A, M, E).  
  1. For each criterion in the **GRADING_LEVELS**, evaluate whether it is "Met" or "Not Met" and present this in a table format.
  2. Identify explicit evidence supporting or contradicting the criteria and use this evidence to justify each evaluation.
  3. Highlight gaps or inconsistencies in alignment with the grading levels and provide actionable feedback focusing on improvements and next steps.
