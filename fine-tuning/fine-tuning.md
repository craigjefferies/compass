# Fine Tuning: Adapting Clarifications with NCEA Moderation Feedback

The **Clarifications** section in Compass enables the refinement of grading prompts and feedback based on insights from NCEA moderation and exemplar documents. Fine-tuning this section ensures the AI teaching assistant provides feedback that aligns closely with NCEA grading standards and expected levels of achievement.

## Purpose of Fine Tuning

Fine-tuning allows Compass to:
1. **Reflect Authentic NCEA Standards**: Integrate insights from NCEA exemplars and moderation feedback to ensure feedback aligns with official grading criteria.
2. **Provide Precise Guidance**: Adapt feedback language to specify what each grading level (e.g., Not Achieved, Achieved, Merit, Excellence) looks like in practice.
3. **Enhance Accuracy and Consistency**: Ensure feedback consistency with NCEA standards, promoting clear student understanding of grading criteria.

## Fine-Tuning Process

Follow these steps to adjust the **Clarifications** section based on NCEA moderation feedback and exemplars:

### 1. Review NCEA Exemplars and Moderation Feedback
   - Access **NCEA exemplars** and **moderation reports** for the specific Achievement Standard.
   - Identify **patterns** in feedback across grading levels, focusing on areas where students commonly excel or need improvement.
   - Note key indicators for each level (Not Achieved, Achieved, Merit, Excellence) and specific language or expectations outlined in the exemplars.

### 2. Identify Key Adjustments for Each Grading Level
   - Look for nuances in the feedback language to clarify expectations. For instance, **descriptors** like "thorough," "detailed," or "basic" may need additional context.
   - Note common feedback phrases or terms used by moderators to enhance clarity and alignment in the grading prompts.

### 3. Update Clarifications for Each Achievement Level
   - Adjust **Evaluation** and **Key Indicators** for each level (Not Achieved, Achieved, Merit, Excellence) based on the findings:
     - **Not Achieved**: Include common areas where students miss expectations, such as lack of specific examples or weak connections to context.
     - **Achieved**: Emphasize fundamental but accurate understanding of key concepts.
     - **Merit**: Highlight analytical depth and connections to purpose, audience, or context.
     - **Excellence**: Reinforce insights and nuanced understanding with clear, sophisticated responses.

### 4. Refine Prompts in the Approach Section
   - Adapt **Approach** prompts to better guide students based on the updated clarifications:
     - Use questions that encourage students to address specific areas commonly missed at each level.
     - Incorporate prompts that lead students toward analysis or detail expected at higher levels.

### 5. Test with Sample Responses
   - **Simulate teaching assistant responses** using the newly tuned prompts.
   - Compare these responses to official NCEA exemplars to verify alignment, adjusting further as needed for accuracy and completeness.

## Example Fine-Tuning Adjustments

Here’s an example of how you might refine prompts for an Achievement Standard in English:

- **Original Clarification (Merit)**:
  - *Evaluation*: "Explains how specific examples of verbal language use are shaped by context."
  - *Key Indicators*: "Provides specific explanations connecting language choices to context, exploring effectiveness."
  - *Approach Prompt*: “Why do you think this choice resonates with this audience?”

- **Fine-Tuned Clarification (Merit)**:
  - *Evaluation*: "Explains the influence of context on language choices with relevant examples."
  - *Key Indicators*: "Uses examples to demonstrate context shaping language choice, showing an understanding of purpose and audience."
  - *Approach Prompt*: “In what ways does this language choice suit the intended audience? How does context shape this choice?”

By refining prompts in this way, Compass ensures that feedback is both accurate and helpful, guiding students toward achieving higher levels in their assessments.
