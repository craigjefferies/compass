### ACHIEVEMENT STANDARD SPECIFICS

**ACHIEVEMENT_STANDARD_TITLE**: Develop a Prototype Considering Fitness for Purpose in the Broadest Sense (Technology - AS91611)  
**ACHIEVEMENT_STANDARD_PURPOSE**: This achievement standard involves developing a prototype considering fitness for purpose in the broadest sense.  
**ACHIEVEMENT_STANDARD_CREDITS**: Level 3, 6 Credits  

**ACHIEVEMENT_CRITERIA_GRADING_LEVELS**:

- **ACHIEVEMENT (A)**: Develop a prototype considering fitness for purpose in the broadest sense involves:
  - considering the context when determining the suitability of materials and/or components, and of practical techniques and processes
  - selecting suitable materials and/or components; tools and equipment; and applying techniques and processes to make the prototype
  - using results from testing and stakeholder feedback to inform the making and trialling of the prototype
  - prototyping to gain specific evidence of fitness for purpose
  - explaining any decisions to accept and/or modify the prototype based on a judgement against the brief.

- **MERIT (M)**: Develop a refined prototype considering fitness for purpose in the broadest sense involves:
  - evaluating the way the combination of selected materials and/or components and practical techniques and processes work together to ensure their effectiveness in making a prototype.

- **EXCELLENCE (E)**: Develop a justified prototype considering fitness for purpose in the broadest sense involves:
  - synthesising evidence from ongoing testing (including prototyping) and stakeholder feedback to optimise the prototype and justify the prototype’s fitness for purpose against the brief.

**ACHIEVEMENT_STANDARD_KEY_TERMS**:
- **Context**: The wider social and physical environment in which technological development occurs.
- **Prototype**: A completed outcome yet to be fully implemented, developed through technological practice and reflective of relevant codes of practice.
- **Prototyping**: Trialling the prototype to gain evidence for evaluating the outcome’s fitness for purpose in its intended physical and social environment (context).
- **Fitness for Purpose in the Broadest Sense**: Includes the prototype and the practices used to develop it, considering aspects such as technical and social acceptability, sustainability, ethics, cultural appropriateness, life cycle, maintenance, disposal, and health and safety.
- **Brief**: Allows judgement of the outcome’s fitness for purpose in the broadest sense, encompassing design and development processes.

### ACHIEVEMENT_STANDARD_GRADING CLARIFICATIONS

- **NOT ACHIEVED (N1 & N2):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Does not meet all **ACHIEVEMENT_CRITERIA_GRADING_LEVELS**.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** Lacks key elements such as stakeholder feedback, testing evidence, or context consideration in informing the prototype’s development. The prototype may fail to align with the brief or inadequately address fitness for purpose in the broadest sense.
  - **APPROACH:** Encourage the student to incorporate stakeholder feedback and refine their prototype through testing. For example, “What stakeholder input could improve material selection?” or “How can additional testing results inform your design decisions?” Highlight the importance of evaluating how the prototype aligns with broader considerations like sustainability, ethics, or social acceptability.

- **ACHIEVED (A3 & A4):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Develops a prototype considering fitness for purpose in the broadest sense.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:**
    - Considers the context when selecting suitable materials, components, tools, and techniques.
    - Applies practical techniques and processes to create the prototype.
    - Uses testing results and stakeholder feedback to inform decisions.
    - Explains modifications to the prototype based on judgements against the brief.
  - **APPROACH:** Prompt students to elaborate on how testing and stakeholder feedback shaped their prototype. For example, “What specific evidence supports your design choices?” or “How does your prototype align with the brief’s specifications and the intended environment?” Encourage refinement by asking, “How could evaluating the material and technique choices further ensure fitness for purpose?”

- **MERIT (M5 & M6):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Develops a refined prototype by evaluating the effectiveness of materials, components, and techniques to ensure alignment with fitness for purpose in the broadest sense.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:**
    - Demonstrates iterative refinement based on evidence from testing and stakeholder feedback.
    - Evaluates how selected materials, components, and practical techniques work together to optimize the prototype.
    - Considers broader implications such as sustainability, ethics, and social acceptability during development.
  - **APPROACH:** Encourage students to provide detailed evaluations of material and technique choices. For example, “How does the combination of materials and processes contribute to the prototype’s functionality?” or “What improvements could enhance the prototype’s sustainability or usability?” Highlight the importance of addressing broader considerations like product maintenance or disposal.

- **EXCELLENCE (E7 & E8):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Develops a justified prototype by synthesizing evidence from testing, prototyping, and stakeholder feedback to optimize and justify the prototype’s fitness for purpose in the broadest sense.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:**
    - Synthesizes evidence from iterative testing and stakeholder input to justify decisions.
    - Considers broader implications, including sustainability, ethics, cultural appropriateness, and long-term impact.
    - Justifies design choices with clear connections to how the prototype meets the brief and aligns with its intended environment.
  - **APPROACH:** Encourage reflection on broader implications and justification of decisions.
