# Fine Tuning: Using Clarifications for Better Alignment with NCEA Standards

The **Clarifications** section in Compass refines the LLM’s feedback using **Evaluation**, **Key Indicators**, and **Approach** for each grading level. Each element provides a focused way to ensure the assistant’s feedback aligns closely with NCEA grading criteria and standards.

### Purpose of Fine Tuning

Fine-tuning allows Compass to:
1. **Match NCEA Standards**: Ensure the assistant's feedback is consistent with official criteria and expectations.
2. **Provide Precise Feedback**: Guide the LLM to respond in a way that reflects each level’s requirements, helping students understand how to improve.
3. **Maintain Consistency**: Increase accuracy by using clear benchmarks across different grading levels.

## Fine-Tuning Elements

Each clarification is made up of three elements that serve specific roles in guiding the LLM’s responses:

### 1. **Evaluation**
   - **What it Represents**: An overview statement describing what is required to meet the specific grading level.
   - **Role in Fine-Tuning**: Defines the key expectations of each level (e.g., Not Achieved, Achieved, Merit, Excellence), giving the LLM a simple benchmark to guide feedback.
   - **How it Helps**: Ensures the assistant’s feedback stays aligned with NCEA grading standards by setting clear level-specific goals.

### 2. **Key Indicators**
   - **What it Represents**: Specific characteristics or qualities that distinguish work at each grading level.
   - **Role in Fine-Tuning**: Provides detailed benchmarks for each level that clarify what the assistant should look for in student responses.
   - **How it Helps**: Improves feedback quality by highlighting what’s typical for each level, from “basic description” (Achieved) to “sophisticated analysis” (Excellence). Helps the assistant recognize and reflect on these elements to match NCEA expectations.

### 3. **Approach**
   - **What it Represents**: Suggested prompts or questions to guide students in improving their work.
   - **Role in Fine-Tuning**: Provides the assistant with ways to prompt the student toward deeper thinking or more specific improvements, based on where they currently stand.
   - **How it Helps**: Encourages the LLM to help students reach the next level by asking guiding questions. This makes feedback more interactive and supportive, encouraging students to reflect and revise their responses based on the specific level requirements.

## How to Apply Fine-Tuning

When fine-tuning, you can:
1. **Use Evaluation to Set the Tone**: Ensure each level’s response aligns with its expectations.
2. **Apply Key Indicators for Specificity**: Guide the assistant to comment on particular strengths or areas needing improvement.
3. **Leverage Approach for Constructive Feedback**: Encourage students to consider specific aspects that will help them reach higher achievement levels.

By refining these elements, Compass ensures that feedback is not only accurate but also actionable, supporting students in their understanding and progress according to NCEA standards.
