# Compass: Custom GPT Framework for NCEA Achievement Standards

``` This is in early Development Phase ... ```

**Compass** is a framework designed to help educators in New Zealand create custom GPT models aligned with **Achievement Standards** within the NCEA (National Certificate of Educational Achievement) framework. This tool guides teachers in crafting AI-driven learning assistants tailored to specific assessment standards, providing students with interactive support that matches the learning outcomes and grading criteria of each Achievement Standard.

## Why Use Compass?

Compass helps educators:
- **Create targeted AI assistants** that align with NCEA Achievement Standards, allowing students to receive feedback directly related to their learning goals.
- **Customize GPT interactions** to prompt students with questions and feedback that build understanding step-by-step.
- **Simplify moderation and grading** by integrating Achievement Standards into AI feedback, ensuring that student responses meet NCEA expectations.

## Key Features

- **Structured Instruction Modules**: Easily configure structured instruction modules that guide the GPT to ask relevant questions, helping students engage with the material in meaningful ways.

- **Achievement Standard Integration**: Align each GPT model with specific NCEA Achievement Standards, allowing the AI to provide feedback based on real grading criteria (Achieved, Merit, and Excellence).

- **Adaptable Prompts and Fine-Tuning**: Customize prompts and responses to fit various Achievement Standards. This helps keep interactions relevant to the specific learning outcomes and criteria.

- **Modular Fine-Tuning Framework**: The fine-tuning setup is organized into three main sections:
  - **Static Instructions**: Generic instructions that describe how the LLM is to behave in an educational context.
  - **Standard-Specific Content**: Tailor prompts to the unique requirements of each Achievement Standard.
  - **Clarifications for Grading**: Detailed criteria for Achieved, Merit, and Excellence levels, which help the GPT respond with clarity and accuracy.
