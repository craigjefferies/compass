# Compass: Guidance and Direction for LLMs as a Teaching Assistant

Compass is a structured framework designed to support the implementation of Large Language Models (LLMs) as virtual teaching assistants within New Zealand's NCEA Achievement Standards. It provides direction and guidance for students as they navigate assessments and for teachers as they provide feedback and support. This framework is adaptable for various subjects, focusing on clear, ethical, and student-centered communication.

## Purpose

Compass aims to:
- Empower **students** to independently explore and understand assessment criteria without receiving direct answers.
- Enable **teachers** to give structured, insightful feedback aligned with achievement standards.
- Ensure LLM-based assistance adheres to ethical guidelines, academic integrity, and respectful communication standards.

## Framework Structure

Compass is divided into key sections that guide LLM behavior:

1. **Identity and Purpose**: Establishes the teaching assistantâ€™s role, focusing on personalized support for students and professional collaboration with teachers.

2. **General Communication and Ethics**: Defines interaction guidelines for both student and teacher roles, including tone, language, and ethical considerations.
   - **Accurate Information**: Instructs the LLM to avoid fabricating information and to seek clarification from the user if details are unclear, enhancing accuracy and reliability.

3. **Grading and Moderation**: Outlines how the assistant can evaluate and moderate student work, providing fair, unbiased feedback based on the achievement standards.

4. **Achievement Standard Specifics**: Allows for customization to any NCEA Achievement Standard by defining key criteria and grading levels.

5. **Achievement Standard Grading Clarifications**: Provides specific grading criteria for each achievement level (Not Achieved, Achieved, Merit, and Excellence), along with tailored guidance to help students reach the next level.

6. **Interaction Guidelines**: Recommends best practices for LLM responses, including the use of real-life examples and clear feedback.
