### Ideas

**Skill focus**: The relevance, quantity, quality, selection, and elaboration of ideas for the topic.

**Definition**:
- **Quality of ideas**:  
  Simple ideas are related to the personal, immediate world of the writer (concrete, predictable, familiar, personal, and/or close to the writer's experience).  
  Complex ideas may involve generalisation, abstraction, and reflection on the wider world and groups of people.

- **Selection of ideas**:  
  The deliberate choice of relevant ideas or subject matter to engage and influence the reader.

- **Elaboration of ideas**:  
  Elaboration should be relevant and may be given by providing background information or factual detail, describing, explaining, providing evidence, analysing, or evaluating.

|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| R1     | Ideas are unrelated to the topic **OR** one brief, simple idea related to the topic                               | One idea may be repeated                         |
| R2     | Text has a few simple, unelaborated ideas related to the topic                                                   | Ideas may be disconnected or brief points in a list |
| R3     | Text has many simple, unelaborated ideas **OR** an idea is related to the topic and has some basic elaboration    | Some evidence of a main idea (e.g., persuasive text may take a position) |
| R4     | Ideas are relevant and begin to show some complexity **AND** text has one elaborated idea **OR** several ideas that have some elaboration | Elaboration may lack depth and detail. Complexity may not be controlled. |

| R6     | Ideas show insight, originality, some authority, and/or reflection on the wider world **AND** are deliberately selected, effective, and elaborated | Complex issues/themes are raised. Main idea is focused. |

### Structure and Language

**Skill focus**: The presence and development of structural and language features appropriate to the specified purpose.

**Definition**:
- **Structural features**:  
  The component parts that are typically associated with a text written for a particular purpose. For example, when narrating, structural features may include an orientation to the context (place, time, and participants), a series of events/actions, a problem or complication, and a resolution.

- **Language features**:  
  The language patterns that are typically associated with a text written for a particular purpose. These include selection of tense, tone, text connectives, and vocabulary. For example, when narrating, typical language features include use of past tense, connectives denoting time (to provide a clear sequence of events), expressive and/or descriptive vocabulary, and dialogue.

| R4     | Structural features are appropriate and show development (may include one well-developed element, others less developed) **AND** language features are appropriate | -                                                 |

### Organisation

**Skill focus**: The organisation of ideas into a coherent text.

**Definition**:
- **Coherence**:  
  The way ideas are linked to each other and to the broader context of the writing and/or the wider world to produce a text that is meaningful to the reader. When the text is coherent, the relationships between ideas are clear and the writing ‘flows.’  
  When assessing a text’s coherence, look for clear text connectives, consistency of verb tense, and accuracy of referring words (e.g., pronouns) across the text as a whole.  
  **Note**: The focus is on the text as a whole, rather than on individual sentences.

| **R#** | **Descriptor**                                                                                                     | **Notes**                                           |

| R2     | Text attempts to group and sequence ideas                                                                        | Some ideas are grouped spatially, temporally, or logically |
| R3     | Text has some coherence                                                                                          | Errors in or absence of linking words or inconsistencies in tense across text may interrupt flow |
| R4     | Ideas are grouped and sequenced, and text generally flows. Text may be brief but coherent                        | Errors in or absence of linking words or inconsistencies in tense do not interrupt flow |
| R5     | Text shows control over grouping and sequencing of ideas, but paragraphs are not used or indicated incorrectly   | Paragraphs have minimal development (e.g., one sentence), or some paragraph breaks are not indicated |
| R6     | Ideas are organised into basic paragraphs. Paragraphs support text development                                   | Some paragraphs may be out of sequence           |
| R7     | Paragraphs are deliberately structured to direct the reader. Ideas are linked effectively within and across paragraphs | Subheadings, topic sentences, and linking words are present and appropriate |

### Vocabulary

**Skill focus**: The range, precision, and effectiveness of word choices appropriate to the topic.

**Definition**:
- **Simple everyday words**: Words that are related to the personal world of the writer; words that are used frequently.
- **Precise words**: Words that are descriptive, expressive, academic, technical, or abstract.

| R6     | Precise language choices consistently enhance meaning and/or mood                                                | Deliberate and sustained use of precise vocabulary (descriptive, expressive, academic, technical, abstract) for effect |

### Sentence Structure

**Skill focus**: The quality, effectiveness, and correctness of sentences.

**Definition**:
When judging the correctness of each sentence, consider the following (note: the focus is on the use of correct forms within a sentence, rather than between sentences or paragraphs):
- Word form (e.g., singular or plural).
- Verb tense.
- Subject−verb agreement.
- Articles and pronouns.
- Use of prepositions and relative pronouns to expand sentences.
- Arrangement of (order of) elaborating phrases and clauses.
- Missing words.
- Order of words.

**Note**: In order to make assessment of sentence structure more manageable, ‘read in’ missing or incorrect sentence punctuation (including full stops). (Punctuation is assessed separately, in the ‘Punctuation’ element.)

| R5     | Correct sentences show variety in structure, length, and type, with extending phrases and/or clauses **OR** all sentences are correct but repetitive | Meaning is clear (may be some inconsistency or minor error). Sentences express precise meaning. |
