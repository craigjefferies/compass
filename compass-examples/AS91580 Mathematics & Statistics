### ACHIEVEMENT STANDARD SPECIFICS

**ACHIEVEMENT_STANDARD_TITLE**: Investigate Time Series Data (Mathematics and Statistics - AS91580 V2)  
**ACHIEVEMENT_STANDARD_PURPOSE**: Students demonstrate their ability to investigate time series data by using existing data sets, selecting variables, identifying features, modeling, forecasting, and drawing conclusions.  
**ACHIEVEMENT_STANDARD_CREDITS**: Level 3, 4 Credits  

**ACHIEVEMENT_CRITERIA_GRADING LEVELS**:
- **ACHIEVEMENT (A)**: Investigate time series data involves showing evidence of using each component of the statistical enquiry cycle.
- **MERIT (M)**: Investigate time series data, with justification involves linking components of the statistical enquiry cycle to the context, and referring to evidence such as statistics, data values, trends, or features of visual displays in support of statements made.
- **EXCELLENCE (E)**: Investigate time series data, with statistical insight involves integrating statistical and contextual knowledge throughout the statistical enquiry cycle, and may include reflecting about the process; considering other relevant variables; evaluating the adequacy of any models; or showing a deeper understanding of models.

**ACHIEVEMENT_STANDARD_KEY TERMS**:

- **Statistical Enquiry Cycle for Time Series Data**:
  - **Using Existing Data Sets**: Work with pre-existing data sets relevant to the context.
  - **Selecting a Variable to Investigate**: Choose a specific variable within the data set to analyze.
  - **Selecting and Using Appropriate Displays**: Use visual tools such as time series plots to display data trends over time.
  - **Identifying Features in the Data and Relating to Context**: Recognize patterns, trends, seasonality, and outliers in the data and connect them to the given context.
  - **Finding an Appropriate Model**: Choose a model (e.g., trendlines or smoothing techniques) that effectively represents the time series data.
  - **Using the Model to Make a Forecast**: Utilize the model to make predictions about future data points.
  - **Communicating Findings in a Conclusion**: Summarize the investigation with clear conclusions supported by statistical evidence.

### ACHIEVEMENT_STANDARD_GRADING CLARIFICATIONS

- **NOT ACHIEVED (N1 & N2):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Has not fully met one or more of the **ACHIEVEMENT_CRITERIA_GRADING_LEVELS**.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** Minimal understanding or incomplete analysis of time series data.
  - **APPROACH:** Guide the student to start by plotting the data and identifying basic trends. Ask questions like, “What do you notice about the trend over time?” and “Are there any outliers or unusual patterns?”

- **ACHIEVED (A3 & A4):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Demonstrates understanding by using the statistical enquiry cycle to investigate time series data, including selecting variables, creating displays, and making basic forecasts.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** Clear identification of trends and use of a simple model for predictions.
  - **APPROACH:** Encourage the student to explain their variable selection and predictions. Use questions like, “What does your forecast suggest about future data trends?” and “How does your model explain the pattern you observed?”

- **MERIT (M5 & M6):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Justifies conclusions by linking data features to the context and providing evidence such as trends, statistics, or visual features.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** Contextualized analysis and well-supported conclusions with data evidence.
  - **APPROACH:** Guide the student to provide evidence supporting their model and predictions. Ask questions like, “What evidence supports your forecast?” and “How does this trend relate to the context of the data?”

- **EXCELLENCE (E7 & E8):**
  - **EVALUATION:** Demonstrates statistical insight by integrating statistical and contextual knowledge, reflecting on the process, and evaluating model adequacy.
  - **KEY INDICATORS:** Insightful analysis, including evaluation of model limitations and considering additional variables or factors.
  - **APPROACH:** Encourage the student to reflect on their process and consider alternative models. Use questions like, “What limitations might your model have?” and “What other variables could influence the data trends?”
